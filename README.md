# Hangman-Game
My first attempt to create a hangman's game, I didn't use any references, I did everything based on my logic.

<h3>- GAME RULES:</h3>

  - You have 6 letter kicks before the man is hanged;
  - The program only accepts lowercase letters and nothing else;
  - If you mistakenly press a key that has already been considered wrong, the program will not count it as an attempt;
  - The same goes for the correct letters;

<br>

<h3>- RECOMMENDATIONS:</h3>

  - I recommend using .NET 7.0 (dotnet 7.0);
  - The program does NOT work with online compilers (it doesn't actually work very well);
  - I do not recommend testing the program in the terminal of your IDE/text editor (unless there's no problem), compile the program and run the executable file!
